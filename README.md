## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is an music genre classification project.

It aims to identify the genre of a music file.

I used google colab in order to complete it. I used a given genres.tar file having 10 different genre and 100 of music files within it. the technique i used is as follows:
converting those files into melspectrogram and preprocess those images. Then, using a sequential model and train 80% of the images. As the dataset is small i use adam as an optimizer.
